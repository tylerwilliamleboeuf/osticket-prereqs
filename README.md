<p>
Creating a Virtual Machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure provides the environment needed to host and run the osTicket application. In this step, we configure the basic settings such as the resource group, region, operating system, and hardware specifications. This ensures we have a Windows 10 machine ready for remote access and installation of required components.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>2. Connect to the VM </h3>
 
  - Use Remote Desktop to connect to osticket-vm with your credentials.

</p>
Once the VM is deployed, we use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to it. This allows us to interact with the Windows 10 environment just like a local machine. This connection is essential for performing all further configuration and installation steps. 
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>3. Prepare Installation Files </h3>
 
- Download osTicket-Installation-Files.zip (https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1b3RBkXTLNGXbibeMuAynkfzdBC1NnqaD&export=download) to the desktop.
- Extract the contents to a folder named osTicket-Installation-Files.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jnpRMyU.png" />
<p> Downloading and organizing the osTicket installation files upfront ensures all required software components are readily available. This includes osTicket itself, PHP, MySQL, and necessary IIS modules. Extracting them into a dedicated folder keeps the setup process smooth and structured.
</p> 
<br />

<p>
  <h3>4. Install IIS with CGI </h3>
 
- Open Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows features on or off.
- Enable: Internet Information Services Under World Wide Web Services > Application Development Features: check CGI.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lhkyk0x.png"/>
</p>
<p>
IIS (Internet Information Services) is required to serve web pages, and the CGI feature is needed for PHP to function properly with osTicket. Enabling these ensures our server environment can run dynamic PHP scripts.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>5. Install PHP Manager and URL Rewrite Module </h3>
 
 From the osTicket-Installation-Files folder:
- Install PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi.
- Install rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bD2USwo.png"/>
</p>
<p>
The PHP Manager simplifies managing PHP settings in IIS, while the URL Rewrite Module is essential for clean, user-friendly URLs. Both are necessary for osTicket to run smoothly in a Windows environment.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>6. Set Up PHP </h3>
 
- Create a directory: C:\PHP.
- Extract php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip into C:\PHP.
- Install VC_redist.x86.exe.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XOBm0X9.png"/>
</p>
<p>
PHP is the scripting language osTicket is built on. This step installs the correct version and runtime components required for PHP to operate on Windows and communicate with IIS.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>7. Install MySQL </h3>
 
Run mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi.
- Choose Typical Setup.

After installation, launch the Configuration Wizard:
- Select Standard Configuration.
- Set Username & Password.
- Finish Installation.

</p>
<p>
MySQL is the database system that stores all osTicket data, including user info, tickets, and settings. This step ensures we have a functioning backend for the application to interact with.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>8. Configure PHP in IIS</h3>
 
- Open IIS Manager through Windows search bar and run as administrator.
- Double-click PHP Manager.
- Click Register new PHP version.
- Browse to C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe and select it.
- Restart IIS: In the right pane, click Restart under Manage Server.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/BN31CL5.png"/>
</p>
<p>
Registering the PHP executable with IIS allows the web server to process `.php` files. Without this configuration, the osTicket setup would not function or display properly.
</p>
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>9. Deploy osTicket</h3>
 
- Extract osTicket-v1.15.8.zip from the osTicket-Installation-Files folder.
- Copy the upload folder to C:\inetpub\wwwroot.
- Rename upload to osTicket.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rEGYIAb.png"/>
</p>
<p>
Deploying the osTicket files to the IIS web root makes the application accessible via the web browser. This is a key step in preparing the software for installation and configuration.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>10. Access osTicket in Browser</h3>
 
In IIS Manager:
- Expand Sites > Default Web Site > osTicket.
- In the right pane, click *Browse :80.

The osTicket setup page should open in your default browser.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0SJjP5U.png"/>
</p>
<p>
Accessing the osTicket URL in a browser verifies the web server is working and begins the web-based installation. This is where the interactive setup process starts.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>11. Enable PHP Extensions</h3>
 
- In IIS Manager, navigate to Sites > Default Web Site > osTicket.
- Double-click PHP Manager.
- Click Enable or disable an extension.

Enable the following extensions:
- php_imap.dll
- php_intl.dll
- php_opcache.dll

Refresh the osTicket setup page in your browser to confirm the extensions are enabled.

</p>
<p>
osTicket requires specific PHP extensions to function correctly. Enabling these ensures support for internationalization, email fetching, and performance improvements through caching.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>12. Configure osTicket</h3>
 
Rename the configuration file:
- From: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php
- To: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php

Set permissions for ost-config.php:
- Right-click the file > Properties > Security > Advanced.
- Click Disable inheritance and remove all inherited permissions.
- Click Add > Select a principal > type Everyone > Check Names > OK.
- Grant Full control permissions to Everyone.
- Click OK to apply changes.

</p>
<p>
Renaming and setting permissions on the config file is critical for osTicketâ€™s security and operability. This file holds database credentials and app settings, so it must be writable initially, then secured.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>13. Install HeidiSQL and Create Database</h3>
 
- Install HeidiSQL from the osTicket-Installation-Files folder.
- Open HeidiSQL and create a new session:
- Enter Username & Password.
- Connect to the session.
- Right-click in the left pane and select Create new > Database.
- Name the database osTicket.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SIS58Ra.png"/>

</p>
<p>
HeidiSQL is a GUI tool that makes it easy to manage MySQL databases. Here, we use it to create the osTicket database and verify connectivity before finishing installation.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>14. Complete osTicket Web Setup</h3>
 
In the osTicket setup page in your browser:

- Fill in the required fields:
- Helpdesk Name
- Default Email
- Admin Username
- Admin Password
- Database Settings:
- MySQL Database: osTicket
- MySQL Username
- MySQL Password
- Click Install Now!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tHqDp0f.png"/>
</p>
<p>
This step finalizes the software setup through a web interface. Here, we configure helpdesk details and link the application to our MySQL database to enable full functionality.
</p>
<br />

<p>
  <h3>15. Finalize Installation</h3>
 
Upon successful installation:
- Admin Panel: http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php
- End-User Portal: http://localhost/osTicket/

</p>
<p>
After installation, osTicket provides two interfaces: the Admin Panel for backend management and the User Portal for customer ticket submissions. Verifying access ensures everything is configured properly.
</p>
